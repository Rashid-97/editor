# editor
This is the first project I made during 2019-2020 years when I was an intern and it was the first steps in my programming career.

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript/Jquery, PHP (no any frameworks) and SQL Server (MSSQL).
I also used Nginx Web Server and configured it on FreeBSD OS.

To set database connection need to change data in file 'editor/config/db_params.php'.

I put two sql backups (.sql, .bak), hope one of them will be useful :)
